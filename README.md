# Canvas Sample Project

This project is a small **sample app** created to practice working with **Slack’s Circuit**.
It focuses on understanding how Circuit manages UI, state, and navigation in a clean and modern way.

## 🧩 Architecture

The app uses a straightforward, modular architecture:

* **Circuit** for screen models, UI rendering, and navigation.
* **Kotlin Inject with Anvil** for lightweight and compile-time dependency injection.
* **Compose** for building the UI layer.

## 🎯 Purpose

Canvas is meant as a **learning sandbox** — a simple place to try out Circuit patterns, DI setup, and state handling in Kotlin.
